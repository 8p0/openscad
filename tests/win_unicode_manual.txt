# Regression tests for Windows Unicode
# currently we have to run these by hand.
# It can be the basis for creating automated tests in the future

1. cmdline file

- Create a file named ффф.scad with contents 'cube();'
- (you can do this by copy-paste the text above into 'file/save as' in
   Windows Notepad tool)
- Open the windows command prompt (run/cmd)
- set PATH=%PATH%;c:\program files\openscad
- openscad.exe ффф.scad -o "ффф .stl"

Expected result: 

- type 'dir', it should show a file named ффф .stl

2. .com wrapper

repeat test 1 but type 'openscad.com' instead of 'openscad.exe'
 and use ддд instead of ффф

3. .com autowrapping

repeaet test 2 but type 'openscad' instead of 'openscad.com' or 'openscad.exe'

4. output

-mkdir c:\temp1 and c:\temp2
-Run openscad
-cube();
-Hit f6
-Design/export as stl to a filename "c:/temp1/ффф .stl"
-Open Explorer to see if the file saved to the folder c:\temp
-Open the file, see if the contents are ordinary STL

5. import full path

-Run test 4
-import( "c:/temp1/ффф .stl" );

6. OPENSCADPATH

-mkdir c:\temp1 and c:\temp2
-use windows system utils to edit OPENSCADPATH to be c:\temp1;c:\temp2
-make a STL file named " ффф1 .stl" under c:\temp1
-make a STL file named " ффф2 .stl" under c:\temp2
-Run openscad
-import( " ффф1 .stl" );
-import( " ффф2 .stl" );
